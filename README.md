# Kanban Simulation Project

## Description

This project is a simulation of a Kanban system that allows the client to track the progress of a project from the beginning. The interface has been developed to show which stage the project is in, providing a clear visualization of the task status. At this moment, the client cannot add new tasks but can view the project's stages in real time.

## Features

- **Intuitive Interface**: A simple and user-friendly interface that allows the user to quickly see the status of the project.
- **Stage Visualization**: The client can see which phase the project is in, such as:
  - Waiting to Start
  - In Progress
  - Completed
- **Real-Time Updates**: The system is designed to be updated in real time, reflecting the project's progress instantly.
